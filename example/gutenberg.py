Johannes Gutenberg (1398 â€“ 1468) was a German goldsmith and publisher who
introduced printing to Europe. His introduction of mechanical movable type
printing to Europe started the Printing Revolution and is widely regarded as the
most important event of the modern period. It played a key role in the
scientific revolution and laid the basis for the modern knowledge-based economy
and the spread of learning to the masses.

Gutenberg many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for
mass-producing movable type, the use of oil-based ink for printing books,
adjustable molds, and the use of a wooden printing press. His truly epochal
invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system that
allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for
printers and readers alike.
