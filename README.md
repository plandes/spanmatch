# Unsupervised Position-Based Semantic Matching

[![PyPI][pypi-badge]][pypi-link]
[![Python 3.11][python311-badge]][python311-link]
[![Build Status][build-badge]][build-link]

An API to match spans of semantically similar text across documents.  Each
match is a span of text in a source document and another span of text in a
target document that are both tied together.

## Introduction

Spans are formed by a weighted combination of the semantic similarity of the
each document's text and the token position.  Hyperparameters are used to
control which take precedent (semantic similarity or token position for longer
contiguous token spans).

This is done using position embeddings on a third (see Figure 1) axis shows
data blue word embeddings moving from cluster 1 to cluster 2. Cluster spans the
discharge summaries (orange), the note antecedent (green) and arrows connecting
the tokens to word points.

## Documentation

See the [full documentation](https://plandes.github.io/spanmatch/index.html).
The [API reference](https://plandes.github.io/spanmatch/api.html) is also
available.


## Usage

```python
from zensols.cli import CliHarness
from zensols.nlp import FeatureDocument, FeatureDocumentParser
from zensols.spanmatch import Match, MatchResult, Matcher, ApplicationFactory

SOURCE = """\
Johannes Gutenberg (1398 – 1468) was a German goldsmith and publisher who
introduced printing to Europe. His introduction of mechanical movable type
printing to Europe started the Printing Revolution and is widely regarded as the
most important event of the modern period. It played a key role in the
scientific revolution and laid the basis for the modern knowledge-based economy
and the spread of learning to the masses.

Gutenberg many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for
mass-producing movable type, the use of oil-based ink for printing books,
adjustable molds, and the use of a wooden printing press. His truly epochal
invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system that
allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for
printers and readers alike.
"""

SUMMARY = """\
The German Johannes Gutenberg introduced printing in Europe. His invention had a
decisive contribution in spread of mass-learning and in building the basis of
the modern society.
"""

harness: CliHarness = ApplicationFactory.create_harness()
doc_parser: FeatureDocumentParser = harness['spanmatch_doc_parser']
matcher: Matcher = harness['spanmatch_matcher']
source: FeatureDocument = doc_parser(SOURCE)
summary: FeatureDocument = doc_parser(SUMMARY)
# shorten source doc span length by scaling up positional importance
matcher.hyp.source_position_scale = 2.5
# elongate summary doc span length by scaling up positional importance
matcher.hyp.target_position_scale = 0.9
res: MatchResult = matcher(source, summary)
match: Match
for i, match in enumerate(res.matches[:5]):
	match.write(include_flow=False)
```
